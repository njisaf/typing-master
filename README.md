# typing-master

This is a fun little typing trainer game created by Nassir Isaf, Sam Nortz, and Susan Graham-Schuyler for Codefellows 201.
Game will take a random sentence the text.js source text and set a time limit for how long the user has to copy down the text bassed off the number of characters and which round they are on.
Text is currantly being pulled for Terry Pratchett's Gaurds! Gaurds!
We are using Andrei Mackenzie's Levenshtein distance (https://gist.github.com/andrei-m/982927) to compare user entered text against the source text
